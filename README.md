# 🚗 3D Car Scene — Mobile Controls

A visually engaging 3D car driving scene built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), featuring interactive mobile controls. This project simulates a dynamic road environment with a player car, enemy vehicles, and environmental elements like buildings and lighting — optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.
